# Decision Tree Program

### Introduction
This is a program to construct a decision tree with custom outputs. It includes the decision being made, the information gain based on entropy, the ending leaf with its label, purity, and size. It leverages the scikit-learn decision tree classifier. The main program is one function that utilizes multiple functions to read the file and construct the tree. The program can take any csv file with the class as the last column. It was demonstrated on the iris dataset. 

### Highlights
* Demonstrates the use of python functions with function documentation with docstring
* Error handling with try and except to read files and run the program
* Use of for loops, while loops, and if/else statements

### Tools
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sklearn
